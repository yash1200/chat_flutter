# chat_app

A new chat Flutter application built using firestore.


Build taking the help of an article posted on Medium.

Here's the link:https://medium.com/flutter-community/building-a-chat-app-with-flutter-and-firebase-from-scratch-9eaa7f41782e

Features:

1. Shows the users in community in alphabetical order.
2. Shows the users with which you have chatted with chronological order of time(Most recent to least recent).
3. Shows the last message in the chat thread like other chat applications.
More Features to come in the field of UI and media sharing, as I am learning now.

Don't forget to give stars on the project.
